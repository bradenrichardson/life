1. Create branch of life-infra that doesn't deploy api-gateway
2. Configure so it only deploys:
	- WebhookLambda (with lambda code)
		- Historical function that loads in all transactions to a csv in s3
		- Webhook ammends csv file in an S3 bucket
		
	- APIGateway
	- Database  
3. Manually configure UP webhook to point to API Gateway


Scheduling:

- Convert the current calendar bill system to a schedule
- Use this schedule to dynamically populate the bills/utilities parameters
